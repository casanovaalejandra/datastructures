Data Structures can be seen as a house to HOLD data. It does not care whst data is holding.
There are in/out rules on HOW the data ENTERS the house ( data structure).
    - LIFO & FIFO
We do have relations between the data inside the data structure
    - parent node
    - head of list
STACKS
- Pile of data
- LIFO --> Last in first out
- push in constant time
- pop is constant time
- search is linear time
-We are going to create a generic stack, so it can hold any type of object
